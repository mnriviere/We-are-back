# We are happy to announce that Skills Matter is back!

## Our first goal is to restore the library of SkillsCast videos in the coming weeks. Following that we will announce our first schedule of returning conferences.

This next phase of Skills Matter’s journey is made possible thanks to a new venture, the Quad4 Group, led by Frank Rodorigo, whose 25-year history of startup experience and business leadership includes the co-founding of several professional services firms including Valtech USA. In addition to Frank, Quad4 is guided by technical- and thought-leadership from Scott Conley, former Chief Strategy Officer of ThoughtWorks and Frank's Valtech USA co-founder, Chris Tarr. 

The new company will have an increased focus on skills transfer and will be shepherded by a core team of familiar faces — including Wendy Devolder, who will serve as Skills Matter's Chief Community Officer. 

We have always believed in the power of community, and never more so than over these past two months. We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from the community and cannot wait to reconnect so we can thank everyone in person. 

We have some big announcements in the works so please stay tuned in the coming weeks as embark on this next stage of our adventure.
